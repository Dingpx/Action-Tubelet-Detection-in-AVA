# Action Tubelet Detection in AVA
In this project we have adapted the Action Tubelet Detector [1], presented at ICCV17 for the Atomic Visual Action dataset from Google  [2].

The code is a modified version of [https://github.com/vkalogeiton/caffe/tree/act-detector] with the changes required to adapt the code for a new dataset.

To use this code, follow the instructions from the github of the authors of the ACT and generate the metadata needed with the AVA dataset using `generate_ACT_metadata_AVA.py`
